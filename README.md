# Trival Bayesian Computer

I'm just practicing my python — converted a little story problem I had solved in perl into a classifier in python, then resolved the story problem with it

Note that I called the class Classifier … that's not quite right, since it doesn't classify, it just computes.  I had a classifier in mind for the next step, but lost track of what I was doing.
